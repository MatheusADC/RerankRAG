Contextual Compression RAG is an advanced RAG method that solves issues found in simple RAG. It uses the BiEncoder and CrossEncoder to rank relevant documents more efficiently. The BiEncoder separately embeds the query and the chunk, while the CrossEncoder combines both to find similarities. The use of these methods avoids extensive asynchronous processing. The Reranker is used to reorder the most relevant documents, providing a more accurate response.
